An exploratory data analysis of a fictional students dataset.
## Introduction
This is work for educational purposes. I took a fictional dataset about students informations and their tests results, and tried to retrieve some insights about it. 
The idea behind this project was to use some tools that I have learned theoretically, and to get my hands dirty in something I have never done before. 

## The files
In this repository you can find the python notebook with my analysis, and the .csv file of the dataset used. I downloaded my dataset from [Royce Kimmons data generators tools](http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams).

## Conclusion
I hope to have done a not so bad job. Certainly, I have improved my skills and learned different new things while working on this project.
